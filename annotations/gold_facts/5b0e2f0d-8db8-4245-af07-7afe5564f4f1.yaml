  rationale: "Current low BP is a baseline physiologic parameter relevant to today’s assessment."
- code: "D4.TRAJ-01"
  evidence_span: "your blood pressures look much better"
  rationale: "Clinician states improvement trajectory compared with prior hypotension."
- code: "D4.TRAJ-01"
  evidence_span: "she was 170 pounds, indicating that she has gained 16 pounds since last in."
  rationale: "Objective trajectory showing weight increase since last visit."
- code: "D6.SELF-01"
