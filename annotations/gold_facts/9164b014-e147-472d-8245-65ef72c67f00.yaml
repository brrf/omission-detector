  rationale: "States the primary reason for today's visit, which is the patient's chief concern."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "which was 6.52"
  rationale: "PSA is a diagnostic lab with a known result (6.52), so it fits prior diagnostics/results."

- code: "D2.ON-01"
  evidence_span: "in May of 2024"
  rationale: "Provides the timestamp when the elevated PSA was detected, i.e., onset of the current issue."

- code: "D6.PROC-03"
  evidence_span: "No history of prior prostate biopsy"
  rationale: "Documents absence of a relevant prior procedure (prostate biopsy)."

- code: "D6.FAM-05"
  evidence_span: "no family history of prostate cancer"
  rationale: "Initial intake statement about family history relevant to prostate cancer risk (noting later contradiction)."

- code: "D6.FAM-05"
  evidence_span: "El próstata, cáncer de la próstata."
  rationale: "Patient later reports a first-degree relative with prostate cancer, directly modifying risk stratification."

- code: "D6.FAM-05"
  evidence_span: "unos 70 años, 75 por ahí"
  rationale: "Specifies approximate age (70–75) of the affected relative at diagnosis, a useful family-history modifier."

- code: "D3.POS-01"
  evidence_span: "gross hematuria"
  rationale: "Hematuria is an associated positive symptom relevant to the urologic evaluation."

- code: "D2.ON-01"
  evidence_span: "in February 2024"
  rationale: "Dates the episode of gross hematuria, providing temporal context."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "CT abdomen pelvis showing prostate enlargement"
  rationale: "Imaging result documenting prostate enlargement is a prior diagnostic finding."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "no other acute abnormality"
  rationale: "Negative component of the CT report—also a diagnostic finding that narrows differential."

- code: "D4.BASE-02"
  evidence_span: "baseline voiding symptoms mild"
  rationale: "Indicates the patient's baseline urinary symptom status (present at baseline)."

- code: "D2.SEV-09"
  evidence_span: "mild"
  rationale: "Qualifies the severity of baseline voiding symptoms as mild."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "Urinalysis today, no blood"
  rationale: "Same-day UA is a diagnostic test; the absence of blood is the reported result."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "no bacteria"
  rationale: "UA result specifying no bacteriuria, a diagnostic negative."

- code: "D6.DIAG-02"
  evidence_span: "Post-Fried Residual, 201 milliliters today."
  rationale: "Measured post-void residual (201 mL) is a quantitative diagnostic finding."

- code: "D3.PN-02"
  evidence_span: "Tiene alguna molestia en la vía urinaria? No."
  rationale: "Denial of urinary discomfort is a pertinent negative symptom."

- code: "D3.PN-02"
  evidence_span: "Intermittence is no, okay?"
  rationale: "Denies urinary intermittency, a pertinent negative that helps characterize LUTS."

- code: "D2.PAT-08"
  evidence_span: "Less than 2 hours."
  rationale: "Describes voiding pattern (frequency interval <2 hours)."

- code: "D2.NUM-10"
  evidence_span: "I can go 3 or 4 times"
  rationale: "Quantifies the number of voids, a numerical modifier of symptom burden."

- code: "D4.MED-05"
  evidence_span: "The doctor gave me pills to. Tamsulosin."
  rationale: "Active medication (tamsulosin) influences urinary symptoms and bladder emptying."

- code: "D9.SUB-08"
  evidence_span: "No, not anymore."
  rationale: "Establishes current non-smoker status, relevant substance use baseline."

- code: "D9.SUB-08"
  evidence_span: "maybe a cigarette, maybe a month or something."
  rationale: "Indicates minimal prior smoking exposure/change in use, relevant to risk assessment."

- code: "D4.COMO-04"
  evidence_span: "pre-diabetes"
  rationale: "Pre-diabetes is a comorbidity that can influence overall risk and management."

- code: "D4.COMO-04"
  evidence_span: "peptic ulcer, disease"
  rationale: "Peptic ulcer disease is a relevant comorbidity for medication choices and risk."

- code: "D4.COMO-04"
  evidence_span: "hypertension"
  rationale: "Hypertension is a cardiovascular comorbidity relevant to overall management."

- code: "D4.COMO-04"
  evidence_span: "erectile dysfunction"
