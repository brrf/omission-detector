  evidence_span: "there's a typo that says 4 plus 3 equals 6, but yeah, the 7, it's the 7, right?"
  rationale: "Documents Gleason score 7 from pathology—a key risk-stratification detail absent from the HPI."
- code: D4.TRAJ-01
  evidence_span: "my PSA just kept going up, it almost kept, you know, kept like doubling every year"

- code: D6.DIAG-02
  evidence_span: "My EKGs always come back normal."
  rationale: "Summarizes prior cardiac testing trend, helpful context for pre-op risk and the planned EKG; not in the HPI."
- code: D9.SUP-04
  evidence_span: "And Patricia's anxious just to get it out of there too"
  rationale: "Adds spouse’s stance/support, a pertinent psychosocial factor influencing decision-making not captured in the HPI."
